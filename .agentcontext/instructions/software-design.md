# Software Design

Design to prevent complexity before it exists. Use "A Philosophy of Software Design" (John Ousterhout) as the north star.

## The Enemy: Complexity

Complexity shows up as:
1. **Change amplification**: small change touches many places
2. **Cognitive load**: too much must be held in mind
3. **Unknown unknowns**: unclear what to change or what info is needed

Root causes:
- **Dependencies**: code cannot be understood in isolation
- **Obscurity**: important info is not obvious

Treat even small design choices as cumulative complexity decisions.

## Design Methodology

1. **Understand the problem**: requirements, constraints, context, boundaries
2. **Identify abstractions**: what concepts should be modules
3. **Design interfaces first**: simple caller-facing APIs, hidden internals
4. **Evaluate information hiding**: each design decision has one home
5. **Consider alternatives**: compare options before committing
6. **Validate fit**: align with existing patterns and conventions

## Design Principles

**Strategic thinking**
- Optimize for long-term maintainability, not just working code
- Make continual small design investments
- Build abstractions, not only features
- Evaluate system-wide effects of choices

**Module depth**
- Prefer deep modules: simple interface, complex internals
- Simpler interface matters more than simpler implementation
- General-purpose modules are usually deeper
- Keep abstraction levels distinct across layers

**Information management**
- Information hiding is primary
- Pull complexity downward to implementations
- Define errors out of existence when possible
- Encapsulate each design decision in one place

**Separation of concerns**
- Separate general-purpose and special-purpose code
- Avoid temporal decomposition
- Keep related information together; unrelated information apart

## Comments as Design Tools

Comments are design tools, not decoration. They should add information code cannot express (higher-level intent or precise constraints).

**Interface comments**
- Explain what, not how
- Define caller contract: params, returns, side effects, preconditions, errors
- Document edge cases, limits, units, ordering guarantees
- Exclude implementation details

**Implementation comments**
- Explain why this approach exists
- Document non-obvious invariants, assumptions, dependencies
- Capture correctness/performance tradeoffs maintainers must preserve

**Avoid**
- Restating code in English
- Using comments to compensate for weak names/abstractions
- Stale comments that drift from behavior

## Red Flags to Avoid

- **Shallow module**: interface complexity close to implementation complexity
- **Information leakage**: one design decision spread across modules
- **Temporal decomposition**: structure follows execution order, not information
- **Overexposure**: callers must learn rare details for common use
- **Pass-through method**: mostly forwards arguments
- **Repetition**: duplicated logic
- **Special-general mixture**: special-purpose tangled with general-purpose
- **Conjoined methods**: methods cannot be understood independently
- **Hard to name**: abstraction is unclear
- **Hard to describe**: too much responsibility

If these appear, reconsider decomposition.

## Gathering Context

Before recommending designs:
- Use the explore agent to find existing patterns/conventions
- Identify current abstractions and relationships
- Find integration points with existing code
- Check prior approaches and outcomes
- Look for similar solved problems

Do not design in a vacuum; ground recommendations in existing code.

## Presenting Recommendations

- Lead with the recommendation, then rationale
- Use flowing prose for design rationale (not fragmented bullets)
- Use code blocks for interfaces, type definitions, pseudocode
- Use tables sparingly for key tradeoffs
- Use collaborative language ("Consider...", "One approach might be...")

## Questions to Clarify

Ask only when answers materially change the recommendation:
- **Scale**
- **Performance**
- **Integration**
- **Extensibility**
- **Constraints**
- **Priorities**

Do not ask when the design would be the same regardless.
